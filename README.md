# Roboflow Inference Deployment (Edge Inference)

This project demonstrates how to deploy and run a computer vision model on the edge using [Roboflow Inference](https://inference.roboflow.com/), an open-source inference server that can be run via Docker or Python.

## üì¶ Overview

Roboflow Inference allows you to:

* Self-host your model on CPU, GPU, or ARM-based devices.
* Run inference with models trained on Roboflow.
* Deploy using Docker or the `roboflow` Python pip package.

This repository includes a sample Python script to send image data to the inference server and retrieve predictions.

---

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

To deploy the Roboflow Inference server with GPU support:

```bash
docker pull roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-gpu
docker run --gpus all -p 9001:9001 roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-gpu
```

> If you're deploying on a device without a GPU, use the appropriate CPU/ARM image, such as `roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-cpu`.

---

## üêç Python Inference Script

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests pillow
```

Run the script:

```bash
python run_inference.py
```

This script supports:

* Inference using image URLs.
* (Commented) Support for base64 image input.
* (Commented) Support for NumPy image input.

### üîß Configuration

Edit the following variables in `run_inference.py`:

```python
project_id = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"         # Your Roboflow project/workspace ID
model_version = 1                      # The version number of your model
confidence = 0.5                       # Confidence threshold for predictions
iou_thresh = 0.5                       # IOU threshold
api_key = "YOUR_ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"      # Your Roboflow API key
image_url = "https://.../image.jpg"    # Publicly accessible image URL
```

Optional inputs (uncomment one of the following sections):

* Base64 encoded local image
* NumPy image array (requires OpenCV and pickle)

---

## üì§ Output

The script returns predictions in JSON format, containing bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.

Example output:

```json
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      "x": 123,
      "y": 234,
      "width": 50,
      "height": 60,
      "class": "object",
      "confidence": 0.87
    }
  ]
}
```
